## Key Principles

### Vibe Coding Everywhere
- Development: Claude writes code, human writes specs
- Marketing: Claude writes copy, human defines strategy
- Sales: Claude analyzes feedback, human makes decisions

### Ship Every Week
- No week without user-facing progress
- Marketing and sales start from week 1
- Don't get stuck in endless development

### One Tool
- Claude Code for everything
- No v0.dev, Lovable, or other tools
- Prove Claude Code can do it all

## When Working on Course Materials

### Creating Lecture Content
- Always include all three tracks
- Each track needs: theory + hands-on + homework
- Show Claude Code doing the work live

### Creating Templates
- Make them actionable, not theoretical
- Include prompts for Claude Code
- Focus on outputs, not process

### Creating Examples
- All examples must be Claude Code generated
- Show the spec → result flow
- Include the prompts used
