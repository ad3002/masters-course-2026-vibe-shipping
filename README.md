# Vibe Shipping: From MVP to Product

> *Turning code into products people pay for*

## About This Course

You can code. You can build MVPs. But can you get users? This is not a programming course. This is a course about **shipping products** — the hard part that comes after the code works.

**Prerequisite:** [Vibe Coding Part 1](https://github.com/ad3002/masters-course-2025-vibe-coding) — you need BDD/TDD skills, multi-agent workflow experience, and Claude Code proficiency.

**Key idea:** Code without users is a hobby. Product = Code + Marketing + Sales.

### What Makes This Unique

- 🔧📣💰 **Three parallel tracks every week** — not sequential modules, all three together
- 🤖 **Claude Code for everything** — no v0.dev, no Lovable, no other tools
- 🚀 **Ship every week** — no week without user-facing progress
- 💰 **Real metrics** — grading based on actual users and revenue
- 🗣️ **AI co-instructor** — same format as Part 1, voice lectures with Claude

**What you'll learn:**
- Get real users (not just testers)
- Write marketing copy that converts
- Make your first dollar
- Scale without burning out

### 🎙️ Course Format

Like Part 1, this course is delivered through **voice lectures with AI co-instructor**:

- 🗣️ **Live voice interaction**: Aleksey + Claude discussing in real-time
- 🤖 **Claude as co-teacher**: not a tool, but a thinking partner
- 📝 **Live documentation**: notes created during lectures
- 🔄 **Evolving system**: Claude remembers course context

## Philosophy

> "You can build anything. But should you? And for whom?"

└─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

**Vibe Coding principle everywhere:**
- **Development**: Claude writes code, you write specs
- **Marketing**: Claude writes copy, you define strategy
- **Sales**: Claude analyzes feedback, you make decisions

**Why three tracks in parallel?**
- Risk of getting stuck in endless development
- Marketing and sales start from day one
- Users are the real test of your product

## History

This is **Part 2** of the Vibe Coding course series.

**Part 1 (2025)** taught:
- AI-assisted programming fundamentals
- BDD/TDD with Claude Code
- Multi-agent workflows
- Building MVPs in hours

**Part 2 (2026)** teaches:
- Shipping products to real users
- AI-assisted marketing
- AI-assisted sales
- From 0 to paying customers

The transition from "I can build" to "people pay for what I build" is the hardest part. This course bridges that gap.
